# Comparison.

### Backpack and xNFT's.

Let me preface this with saying - I love Backpack and Armani. Both of our projects are dedicated to growing the pie, through building beautiful UX for decentralization.&#x20;

Backpack/xNFT's may seem similar to dappnet, but have pretty different realisations of their direction.

Dappnet is directed towards creating a browser for the permaweb. Censorship-resistant dapps, but also websites, news media, and sharing datasets.&#x20;

Backpack is honing in on building dapps and a great wallet for users.&#x20;

In terms of **technical differences**:

* xNFT's are hosted on Arweave, and cached by the CDN. Backpack must run a CDN, kind of like how Infura runs nodes for Metamask.&#x20;
* Dappnet apps are hosted by IPFS nodes. Anyone can become a host and it can be just as performant (if not more performant). This is more decentralized though is challenging to achieve.
