### Backpack and xNFT's.

Let me preface this with saying - I love Backpack and Armani. Both of our projects are dedicated to growing the pie, through building beautiful UX for decentralization.&#x20;

Backpack/xNFT's may seem similar to dappnet, but have pretty different realisations of their direction.

Dappnet is directed towards creating a bulletproof platform for all types of media. Censorship-resistant dapps, but also websites, news, and datasets.&#x20;

Backpack is honing in on building dapps and a great wallet for users.&#x20;

In terms of **technical differences**:

* xNFT's are hosted on Arweave, and cached by the CDN. Backpack must run a CDN, kind of like how Infura runs nodes for Metamask.&#x20;
* Dappnet apps are hosted by IPFS nodes (and soon BitTorrent). IPFS/BitTorrent employ swarm-based P2P solutions to serving content, where each node can also contribute their resources. The scalability of the two designs is to be considered.
