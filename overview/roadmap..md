# Roadmap.

Dappnet is an open-source project, built as a **public good**.

There are a couple of milestones we are focused on:

* Securing funding for the next year of development.
* Supporting Windows and Linux platforms.
* Improving IPFS performance. Right now we use Kubo, which burns a lot of CPU.
* Onboarding DeFi apps and making sure the UX is reliable.
* More innovation and R\&D:
  * Verifiable RPC
  * Support for in-browser ipfs:// downloads
  * And [much much more](https://github.com/gliss-co/dappnet-features/issues)
