# What is Dappnet?

**Dappnet is a bulletproof way to deploy websites and applications to the web, that can’t be censored, captured or taken down.**

With one install, your browser is upgraded to access .eth domain names on ENS, and load their content from a P2P network called IPFS. **You don't have to configure anything**.

ENS names can't be seized, and IPFS cannot be censored. When one node is censored on IPFS, others can take its place, permissionlessly.

Dappnet runs a local IPFS node and a local Ethereum light node, meaning there is no reliance on an external provider. Your internet connection is all you need to access the Dappnet.

For a detailed overview, see the announcement thread - [https://twitter.com/liamzebedee/status/1578127982173908992](https://twitter.com/liamzebedee/status/1578127982173908992)

**What other people say**:

* A capture-resistant application network, built on ENS and IPFS.
* Self hosted frontend and infrastructure to deliver them.
* An actually usable and performant permaweb client. Local ENS gateway and IPFS client running in the background of your web browser to natively access ENS sites
* Full stack ENS infra built into browsers.
* A place where you can access decentralised domains hosted on decentralised storage.
