# Overview.

Dappnet is a permissionless application network that runs atop [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) and [ENS](https://ens.domains). It works like existing websites - you can host HTML/CSS/JS - but the way the content is located and hosted is completely decentralized.

Users access dapps using a .eth domain name. Dapps are downloaded from a P2P network called IPFS.

### Current work.

**We are looking into building a better solution for 1-click deployment for developers. Please reach out if you are interested.**
